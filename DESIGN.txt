spg Design Notes

* Overview

spg provides two command line binaries that allow you to encrypt and decrypt a
message.

Usage:
$ spgencrypt -k {key} -m {message}
$ spgdecrypt -k {key}

* Requirements

- encrypt binary takes a key and a message
- on success, encrypt binary prints a message reporting success
- decrypt binary only takes a key
- on success, decrypt binary prints plaintext message
- on failure, decrypt binary prints error message (e.g. wrong key)
- cryptographic procedures are shared via a shared library
- symmetric key

* Goal and Non-goals

- Goal: Windows and Linux environments
- Goal: Remain secure and make encryption, decryption very easy
- Goal: Reach a YES/NO/HALT quickly.
- Non-goal: Hardware speedups e.g. SSE3. These tie us to a platform.
- Non-goal: MacOS target. Lack of resources around Apple APIs.

* Design

** Shared library, spg

This is a wrapper library to whatever cryptography library we intend to use.

Unit tests are really just to ensure the API remains the same.

API:
class Crypt;      // interface
class FakeCrypt;  // for testing
class SodiumCrypt;  // wrapper around real implementation

*** Crypt interface

class Crypt {
 public:
  virtual std::optional<std::string> Encrypt(absl::string_view key,
  	  	      	                     absl::string_view plaintext) = 0;
  virtual std::optional<std::string> Decrypt(absl::string_view key,
                                             absl::string_view ciphertext) = 0;
};

*** FakeCrypt

We'll just add the key into plaintext to ensure the test returns an answer
quickly.

(Q for reviewer): Is this safe?

*** SodiumCrypt

We are using libsodium for our cryptographic primitives.

(Q for reviewer): Do you think this is an okay decision?

** CLI programs, spg[encrypt/decrypt]

Going forward, when we say `binaries` we are referring to these two CLI programs.

The encrypt binary takes a key and message and produce a file with the encrypted
message.

The decrypt binary takes a key and scans the existing directory for all files
that could have been encrypted by this key. If it finds only one match, it'll
decrypt that one match. If it finds multiple matches, it'll decrypt the youngest
file (as recorded by the operating system inode timestamp of last touch).

*** interactive mode

If a user is concerned someone may see the message they type, the user can run
the commands without any input to enter interactive mode.

Example:
$ spgencrypt
Key: *****
Message: *****
DONE.
$ spgdecrypt
Key: *****
<Output>
